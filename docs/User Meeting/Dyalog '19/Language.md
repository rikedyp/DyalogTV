## Tacit Techniques with Dyalog version 18.0 Operators
Marshall Lochbaum

?v=czWC4tjwzOQ

"Tacit" programming is a paradigm in which the programmer, rather than
writing a dfn or tradfn that explicitly references arguments, builds a single
derived function and relies on operators and trains to control the flow of
arguments. While purely tacit programming is best used only for recreational
confusion, everyone uses derived functions. Marshall intends to show how
tacit programming can actually help organise your code and reduce
complexity. This talk also introduces three new operators to be released
with Dyalog version 18.0 which will prove crucial to writing clear tacit code:
Atop (⍤), Over (⍥) and Constant (⍨).
