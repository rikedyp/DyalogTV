From an APL perspective, XML is nothing more than a delimited string of text \u2013 and we know how to handle such things in APL (in addition to which we have \u2395XML). Several object-oriented, .NET-driven class libraries exist for manipulating *.xlsx files without the need for Excel itself. These include Syncfusion's XLsIO, which is now provided by, and integrates easily with, Dyalog. Office Automation, using COM techniques, still works but has its limitations (and, of course, still requires Excel to be installed). The newer XML-based tools also have limitations, some of which can be overcome with familiar APL array-oriented magic. RIDE: a New Way to Interact with the Interpreter Nick Nickolov The RIDE (Remote Integrated Development Environment) is a graphical front end that can be used to develop and maintain Dyalog applications, irrespective of the computer that the Dyalog engine is running on.

External Workspaces Morten Kromberg, Technical Director (CTO) & Stig Nielsen, SimCorp (Denmark) An External Workspace is a workspace saved in a new format that allows an application to page code and data into the active workspace on demand, rather than loading the entire workspace when the application starts. The files are memory mapped, which means that processes running on the same machine can share the memory used by the parts of the workspace which have been paged in, and the file is only read by the first process that uses any particular function or variable. SimCorp Dimension is a rapidly growing application. At run time, code is usually loaded from a network drive. The time required to load the workspace and subsequently to page code in from component files is also steadily growing. Details of the implementation of External Workspaces at SimCorp will be discussed \u2013 including some timings.

Tacit Techniques with Dyalog version 18.0 Operators Marshall Lochbaum \"Tacit\" programming is a paradigm in which the programmer, rather than writing a dfn or tradfn that explicitly references arguments, builds a single derived function and relies on operators and trains to control the flow of arguments. While purely tacit programming is best used only for recreational confusion, everyone uses derived functions. Marshall intends to show how tacit programming can actually help organise your code and reduce complexity. This talk also introduces three new operators to be released with Dyalog version 18.0 which will prove crucial to writing clear tacit code: Atop (\u2364), Over (\u2365) and Constant (\u2368). Cor(e) Blimey! What's He Up To Now? John Daintree .NET is Dead. Long live .NET! The .NET Framework ends its life at version 4.x. In 2020, .NET 5 (based on .NET Core) will be released. We'd better get started\u2026 Cross-Platform Configuration Files Richard Smith Configuring the interpreter currently requires a mix of registry entries, environment variables and command-line options. We are at the early stages of designing a portable, human-readable and editable text file format that will greatly simplify the tasks of configuring the interpreter, setting different configurations for different applications, and moving the configurations between platforms. Richard will present an overview of what you might expect in next year's release of Dyalog. Web Enabling SimCorp Dimension Stig Nielsen, SimCorp (Denmark)) As our customers are demanding services rather than software installed on premise, SimCorp has started the journey to transform SimCorp Dimension into a 3-tier solution, preparing for launching a full web-frontend version of the system. SimCorp Dimension consists of both APL and C# code, where APL is the \"driver\" for the entire system. Stig will take you through one of the major architectural changes that will take advantage of the \"multi-concurrency\" features of Microsoft.NET while at the same time continuing to use APL where much of the business logic resides. What's new with HTMLRenderer? Brian Becker Some applications need only a simple user interface, popping up a window for the user to enter a bit of data or displaying messages back to the user. Others applications may need a fully interactive, rich, graphical user interface. HTMLRenderer can address both needs, across every platform where Dyalog runs. Introduced with Dyalog version 16.0, HTMLRenderer offers the Dyalog user the ability to develop graphical user interfaces on Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux and even the Raspberry Pi. Dyalog version 17.1 adds many new features and updates to HTMLRenderer based on user feedback and our own experiences. In this session Brian will provide a review of HTMLRenderer, demonstrate many of its new features, and present some of the tools and frameworks that are available or in development for use with HTMLRenderer. Easy Cross-Platform GUI Creation Josh David Wouldn't it be nice to have a single function to generate an operational GUI? Josh introduces a utility library that enables the cross-platform creation of simple recurrent GUIs. ]Link Morten Kromberg and Ad\u00e1m Brudzewsky The Link system, prototyped by Morten for version 17.0 in 2018 and then substantially rewritten by Ad\u00e1m in 2019, creates an invisible bond between the active workspace and one or more folders in a file system. Each function, operator, namespace or class is linked to a source file. Selected arrays, which are considered to be part of the source code of the application, can also be included in the link. Changes on either side of the link are immediately copied to the other side. The result is that \u2013 without changes to how APL prototyping, development and maintenance is done \u2013 APL source code can be brought under the control of mainstream editors, source code management systems, and other development tools. A Git Workflow For Dyalog APL Paul Mansour, The Carlisle Group (U.S.A.) Git is great, but the newcomer can easily drown in a sea of commands and options. Git doesn't tell you when or why to branch, when or why to merge or rebase, how to version your project or prepare a release. AcreFlow is a radically simplified Git workflow that answers these questions. It is implemented in Dyalog APL so you can branch, commit, and put out new versions directly from the APL session. Shared Code Files Geoff Streeter Shared Code Files (.dwx files) allow code to be called without fully loading the workspace that contains it; code and data is only loaded on demand. This improves the performance of large applications while reducing their memory consumption and initialisation time. Geoff will explore the gestation, development and usefulness of Shared Code Files. TamStat 2019 - Technical Update Michael Baas Michael presents a more technical view of TamStat's implementation and demonstrates a few interesting details behind recent features APLcart: A Novel Approach to Finding Your Way in APL Ad\u00e1m Brudzewsky There is plenty of documentation about what different parts of APL do. For example, in the IDE, you can just press the F1 key while the caret is pointing at a primitive or system function. But what if you know what you want to do, but don't know how to do so? Enter APLcart; the largest ever collection of short APL phrases. Ad\u00e1m presents the interface and demonstrates how you can use APLcart to become a more effective APLer. Just don't upset it! TamStat 2019 Richard Park Stephen Mansour has presented his APL-based statistics framework, with a focus on teaching statistics to undergraduates, at several previous user meetings. This year, Richard presents the latest updates to the TamStat graphical interface with examples. Creating your First Dyalog Jupyter Notebook Richard Park Jupyter Notebooks turn Donald Knuth's Literate Programming into a pragmatic tool for explaining code to other humans. Richard shows you how to use the Dyalog Jupyter kernel with markdown and LaTeX to take the expressiveness of APL, combine it with your finest prose and mathematical expression, and clearly express your solutions with executable code. Why (not) Teach APL? The Art of Teaching Without Teaching Roberto Minervini, Pietro Pio Palumbo, Alessandro Laselli and Gabriele Meroni Roberto Minervini and three of his students from the Italian high school Liceo Scientifico GB Grassi Saronno have developed a web and APL-based puzzle platform called MathMaze. They used this platform at Dyalog '19 to host a puzzle solving contest on Tuesday evening. Their contest, cleverly named \"A Puzzle League\", was designed to encourage contestants to think first whether code or pen and paper would be most suitable before beginning to solve the problem. In this presentation, they discuss different aspects of their contest and MathMaze, from choosing the puzzles to using Py'n'APL to let APL and Django server talk to one another.","title":"Dyalog '19"},{"location":"User%20Meeting/Dyalog%20%2719/#dyalog-19","text":"","title":"Dyalog '19"},{"location":"User%20Meeting/Dyalog%20%2719/#welcome-to-dyalog-19","text":"Gitte Christensen Dyalog Ltd's CEO opens the user meeting.","title":"Welcome to Dyalog '19"},{"location":"User%20Meeting/Dyalog%20%2719/#the-road-ahead","text":"Morten Kromberg In accordance with tradition, Morten will look briefly back over his shoulder before turning his gaze to the future and providing some predictions regarding the road that lies before Dyalog and users of Dyalog APL.","title":"The Road Ahead"},{"location":"User%20Meeting/Dyalog%20%2719/#tacit-techniques-with-dyalog-version-180-operators","text":"Marshall Lochbaum \"Tacit\" programming is a paradigm in which the programmer, rather than writing a dfn or tradfn that explicitly references arguments, builds a single derived function and relies on operators and trains to control the flow of arguments.
