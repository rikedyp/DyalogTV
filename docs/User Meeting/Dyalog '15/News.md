Last year Andy spoke about some of the new(ish) or lesser-known little features of Dyalog that are buried deep in the documentation. There's plenty that he didn't mention, and even more with Dyalog version 14.1, so he's back with the second in a potentially never-ending series of conversations...

As ever, let us know if there are any features that you think would make Dyalog easier to use.

Following a brief review of Dyalog's social media, Fiona turns her attention to one of the main channels through which we communicate with the world – the Dyalog blog. Contributed to by all members of Team Dyalog, posts range from the highly intellectual to the rather more frivolous and cover topics as diverse as explorations of language elements, recollections of why APL evolved in the way it did, personal musings on the future of APL, solutions to previous student competition questions, travelogues and (of course!) the Dyabot. Fiona concentrates on three particular blog posts from the last 12 months and asks the authors of those posts to summarise and take questions/feedback on their musings. Up for discussion are:

Andy highlights some of the new features that have been added to MyDyalog or will be available in the near future, and explains some of the changes to the way in which updates are supplied, etc. Much of what he describes in this talk is Jason Rivers' work (Andy is presenting it since Jason is tied up with AV duties this week); if you have any feedback on MyDyalog then please let Jason know.
