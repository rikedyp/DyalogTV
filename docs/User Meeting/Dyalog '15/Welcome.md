Gitte opens the user meeting and introduces the newest Dyalog team member. She looks to the future of APL, reminds us of the need to actively spread the word about APL to the next generation of users, and suggests that the upcoming 50th anniversary of the first APL workspace offers a good opportunity for celebration and a little evangelism.
