# Short Movies
At our annual User Meeting we try to have an afternoon where the delegates can get together, have some fun and get to know each other away from the auditorium. 

At Dyalog’19 the delegates were split up into teams and their brief was to make a short commercial emphasising why a particular audience would benefit from using APL. We had 3 hours to plan and shoot the movies and the edited movies could be no longer than 2 minutes. Fortunately, we had a team of experienced film makers and editors to guide us through the process and turn the raw footage into something presentable.
