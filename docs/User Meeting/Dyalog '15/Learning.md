Could APL be a good approach to teaching maths/programming in a secondary school?

Roberto tried to answer this question, and he and some of his students tell the story of the APL course used at the school over the last few months. The scene is set with a description of how maths/programming was taught in the Liceo Classico S.M. Legnani secondary school before APL was involved, and the resultant problems. They then explore how maths (both teaching it and learning it) can be completely revolutionised with the introduction of APL.

To maximise our potential as individuals, teams and (ultimately) organisations, we have to take a step back from all of the enabling technologies, processes and tools that surround us and look inwards instead. In this presentation, Gianfranco shows us how to do this by touching on three subjects that start with "you and me" at the centre – Communication, Transparency and Practice.
