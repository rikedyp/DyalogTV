## APLcart: A Novel Approach to Finding Your Way in APL
Adám Brudzewsky

?v=r3owA7tfKE8

There is plenty of documentation about what different parts of APL do. For
example, in the IDE, you can just press the F1 key while the caret is
pointing at a primitive or system function. But what if you know what you
want to do, but don't know how to do so? Enter APLcart; the largest ever
collection of short APL phrases.
Adám presents the interface and demonstrates how you can use APLcart to
become a more effective APLer. Just don't upset it!

Stephen Mansour has presented his APL-based statistics framework, with a
focus on teaching statistics to undergraduates, at several previous user

graphical interface with examples.

## Creating your First Dyalog Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks turn Donald Knuth's Literate Programming into a pragmatic tool for explaining code to other humans. Richard shows you how to use the Dyalog Jupyter kernel with markdown and LaTeX to take the expressiveness of APL, combine it with your finest prose and mathematical expression, and clearly express your solutions with executable code.

## Why (not) Teach APL? The Art of Teaching Without Teaching

Roberto Minervini and three of his students from the Italian high school Liceo Scientifico GB Grassi Saronno have developed a web and APL-based puzzle platform called MathMaze. They used this platform at Dyalog '19 to host a puzzle solving contest on Tuesday evening.

Their contest, cleverly named "A Puzzle League", was designed to encourage contestants to think first whether code or pen and paper would be most suitable before beginning to solve the problem.

In this presentation, they discuss different aspects of their contest and MathMaze, from choosing the puzzles to using Py'n'APL to let APL and Django server talk to one another.
